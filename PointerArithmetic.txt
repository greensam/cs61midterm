CS61 Midterm Study Sheet

Week 1
	pointers and pointer arithmetic
	memory location: address where bytes reside
	data: bytes being pointed to
	logical array index

	Concept: use address of operator (&) to move from a[b] to &a[b]. a[b] is the data at that location, &a[b] is the address of that data.

	Funky syntax thing:a[5] = *(a + 5) = *(5 + a) = 5[a]

	More pointer review
	3 kinds of comparisons: (1) data/value (2) point to same memory (3) are the same memory
	value comparison vs address of value comparison---one can be equal without the other
