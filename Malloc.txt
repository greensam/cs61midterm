Concepts: linked lists, memory alignment, memory allocation, memory coalescing

How much memory should we allocate when the user requests N bytes?
	Need to allocate additional memory for bookkeeping

	Memory must also be aligned -- ensure the malloc alignment guarantee that memory returned by malloc is sufficiently aligned to hold any piece of data


Fragmentation -- 
	allocation overhead. Reduces mem utilization.

Internal Fragmentation -- 
	space left over in an allocated block not used for data.
	i.e. the bytes needed to 8-byte align the next allocation

External Fragmentation -- 
	space that a particular allocation request can't use because it is broken into pieces
	-- example: 1 MB free memory but an 8B allocation in the middle
	-- possible to reduce external fragment, but usually this happens to allocating memory only in fixed block sizes, increasing internal fragmentation.

Maximal coalescing -- reduction in fragmentation by smart freeing
	-- when needed, actively "move" blocks
